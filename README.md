# MOONSAULT

A super lightweight framework for building applications with native web components and ES6 modules. Moonsault has a few goals:

1. Use native web technologies to create a framework for building applications. Nothing proprietary. Nothing special.
2. Allow individual applications within the framework to set up public APIs to allow for data sharing. Moonsault does not have restrictions on how data can be shared since any public method could be used to send data to another public method.
3. Pages and components are simple web components with their own public and private APIs.
4. ES6 modules and imports can be leveraged to split up the codebase into easy to manage parts.
5. Build processes are supported, but not required in order to facilitate deployment to any environment.

Detailed information about the framework can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/eibonlabs/moonsault/wiki).
